# Welcome to my GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Idoia Rojo, a dynamic and passionate Front-end developer specializing in React and TypeScript. While my career initially began in architecture, my passion for technology led me to transition into the dynamic world of web development. Over the years, I have honed my skills, evolving from a Full-stack developer proficient in Ruby on Rails to leading the Front-end team at Ifeelonline.
